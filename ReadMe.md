# This is a ReadMe file for the "Etch a Sketch" game (ECE434 HW01), as written by James Werne.

# First, after downloading the file, type "chmod +x etchasketch.py" into the command line
# Next, execute etchasketch.py, and follow the instructions in the terminal.

# ADDITIONAL INFO:
# The code has three primary functions: main, newsketch, and etchasketch. Main asks for setup information, such as the dimensions of the board, and handles
# all user inputs. Newsketch generates the board and a cursor in the center (based on the dimensions entered in main). Etchasketch then accepts several possible inputs to move the cursor:
# w = up
# a = left
# s = down
# d = right
# wa or aw = up/left diagonal
# as or sa = left/down diagonal
# sd or ds = right/down diagonal
# dw or wd = up/right diagonal

# This then moves your cursor and places an "x" in the new location.
# In order to "shake" the board, simply type "clear"
